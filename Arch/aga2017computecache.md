# Compute Caches

## Background

Memory wall: memory latency has remained relatively constant.

One solution: build a deep memory hierarchy.

Another solution: move compute closer to memory, a.k.a. process-in-memory.

## Methodology

Bit-line SRAM circuit technology.

## Comments

Caches can both store and compute.
