# Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks

Kipf and Welling [ICLR, 2017]

## Motivation

* CNN cannot deal with Non-euclidean Structure, which is not translation invariant.
* Generalized topology relation can be estabished in normative space, e.g. Spectral Clustering.

## Relative works

* Vertex Domain: neighbors.
* Spectral Domain: Fourier Transformation on graphs, convolution on graphs

## Methodology
