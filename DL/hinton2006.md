# A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets

Hinton et al. [Neural Computation, 2006]

## Background

Learning is difficult in densely-connected, directed belief nets that have many hidden layers because it is difficult to infer the conditional distribution of the hidden activities when given a data vector.

Variational learning still requires all the parameters to be learned together.

## Methodology
