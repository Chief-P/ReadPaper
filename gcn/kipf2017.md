# Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks

Kipf and Welling [ICLR, 2017]

## Motivation

* CNN cannot deal with non-euclidean structure, which is not translation invariant.
* Generalized topology relation can be estabished in normative space, e.g. Spectral Clustering.

## Relative works

* Vertex Domain: neighbors.
* Spectral Domain: Fourier Transformation on graphs, convolution on graphs.

## Methodology

$H^{(l+1)}=\sigma(\tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \tilde{A} \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} H^{(l)} W^{(l)}).$

first-order approximation of spectral graph convolution.
