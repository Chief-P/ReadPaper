### Problem formulation

Let the image lattice be $p=(x,y,t)$ and the underlying flow field be $w(p)=(u(p),v(p),1)$,
where $u(p)$ and $v(p)$ are the horizontal and vertical components of the flow field, respectively.

Under the brightness constancy assumption, we have the objective function in the continuous spatial domain:

$E(u,v)=\int\psi(|I(p+w)-I(p)|^2) + \alpha\phi(|\nabla u|^2 + |\nabla v|^2)dp$,

where $\psi(\cdot)$ and $\phi(\cdot)$ are robust functions, and $\alpha$ weights the regularization.

### Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)

Target: to find $dU$, $dV$ s.t. the gradient $[\frac{\partial E}{\partial dU};\frac{\partial E}{\partial dV}]=0$.

Fixed-point iteration.
